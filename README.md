## GOTCHAS

Deving locally on OSX i couldnt get the client to connect to elasticsearch even
though i could access it in the browser at http://localhost:9200

This fixed it for now...

The correct way to access is actually through, http://127.0.0.1:9200

Will work it out when i sort out nicer config etc.
